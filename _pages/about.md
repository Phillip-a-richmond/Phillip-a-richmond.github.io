Hi, my name is Phillip Richmond, and I have recently completed my PhD in Bioinformatics from the University of British Columbia. My thesis research focused on expanding the utility of genome sequencing in the diagnosis of rare genetic diseases, and you can find my thesis [here](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0394775). 

I am now working as a Staff Scientist in the newly formed [Precision Health Initiative](https://bcchr.ca/phi) at the BC Children's Hospital Research Institute. My role within this initiative is to develop computational infrastructure solutions, coordinate/support training and education around precision health technologies, and analyze precision health data for patients with undiagnosed genetic diseases emerging from BC Children's Hospital. 

First and foremost, I am a collaborative scientist, who believes that the best science happens in teams of diverse-minded individuals.

## My scientific journey

I've been studying bioinformatics and genomics since joining Dr. Robin Dowell's [bioinformatics laboratory](http://dowell.colorado.edu) in 2010 as a Molecular, Cellular, Developmental Biology undergraduate student at the University of Coloradoâ€”Boulder. Robin taught me how to think critically about research problems, and helped spark a scientific curiosity in me. Alongside other graduate students I was hand-taught coding in perl and bash, and then began using emerging bioinformatic methods including BWA, samtools, bowtie, and IGV. 

My first main research project was on finding the acquired mutations within a directed evolution study using isogenic strains of _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ with different chromosomal copy number, or ploidy. This research went on to be published in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14187), with follow-up work detailing the investigation of adaptive mechanisms published in [Molecular Biology and Evolution](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/34/10/2690/4010934). Within Robin's lab  I was exposed to my passion for teaching, especially teaching bioinformatics analysis and [programming](http://dna.colorado.edu/education-python.html) to other researchers with molecular biology training. I further explored transcriptional regulation in yeast, gaining appreciation for the complexity of how genes are activated and how genomic variants alter gene expression in a [collaboration](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4709078/) with a talented scientist Dr. Tim Read. 

My exposure expanded towards other model organisms across fields of [cancer epigenomics](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/46/4/1756/4731545) and [behavioral genetics](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10519-016-9792-4). In one collaboration, I helped define the problems with using certain mouse models due to [cardiotoxicity of gene editing techniques](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002228281530002X). I spent time studying ethanol sensitivity in mice alongside Dr. Richard Radcliffe, trying to identify the [genomic underpinnings of ethanol tolerance and alcoholism predisposition](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00335-016-9663-6). 

In 2015, I started my PhD in Bioinformatics at UBC in Dr. Wyeth Wasserman's lab, focusing on ways to expand the utility of whole genome sequencing in the diagnosis of rare genetic disorders. I have a special interest in improving and benchmarking methods for variant detection and interpretation, with an emphasis on short tandem repeat expansions. A highlight of the simulation capacity can be seen in the [GeneBreaker framework](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/humu.24163). The interest in short tandem repeats emerged from the discovery of a novel short tandem repeat disorder in the [5'UTR of glutaminase](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1806627), which I detected from whole genome sequencing data in an international study led by Dr. Clara van Karnebeek. This discovery led to the development of a novel short tandem repeat software package called [ExpansionHunter Denovo](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-02017-z) alongside researchers at Illumina, primarily Dr. Egor Dolzhenko and Dr. Michael Eberle, and other international colleagues such as Dr. Mark Bennett and Dr. Melanie Bahlo from Melbourne. I also explored the rare disease modifier space in an international collaboration which focuses on finding prognostic markers of [cerebral demyelination in X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2020.00520/full?report=reader). The multi-omic space is the future of rare disease diagnosis, and I was lucky enough to collaborate with Emma Graham and Dr. Sara Mostafavi on a tool which leverages genomic and metabolomic data called [metPropagate](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2020.00520/full). As my passion for gene regulation never faded, I was able to participate curation of the [JASPAR Transcription Factor database](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/48/D1/D87/5614568), a staple of the Wasserman lab and a useful tool for understanding gene regulation at the sequence level.

Beyond research, I have a passion for teaching and leadership, and have developed and taught open source courses in genome analysis for GenomeBC's [GeneSkool](https://www.genomebc.ca/education-resource/rare-genetic-diseases), Compute Canada, and UBC Advanced Research Computing, including a publication describing [teaching genomics to researchers in the life sciences](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6774052.1/). I am the co-founder and co-chair of the [BCCHR Trainee Omics Group](https://bcchr.ca/tog), an initiative which focuses on training programming and analysis methods for "omics" data. Lastly, as I have a passion for building community and improving trainee experiences at BCCHR, I have served as the BCCHR Trainee Council chair since 2017. 

In my new role with the BCCHR Precision Health Initiative, I will be exploring the use of multi-omic technology in the diagnosis of complex and challenging cases emerging from the clinical domain without a diagnosis. I will also be supporting education and training around genomics and multi-omics for both research and clinical audiences.
